Kwiki Installation Notes
========================

If you are running an Apache web server, you'll want to add a section like
this to your httpd.conf file:

    Alias /kwiki/ <%PWD%>/
    <Directory <%PWD%>/>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        AllowOverride All
        Options ExecCGI
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
        DirectoryIndex index.cgi
    </Directory>

Make all your overrides in:

    config.yaml
    plugins

Don't touch the other files unless you know what you are doing.

Kwiki Plugin Installation Notes
===============================

1) Download and install plugins from CPAN
2) Add the new module names to the 'plugins' config file
3) Type 'kwiki -update'
