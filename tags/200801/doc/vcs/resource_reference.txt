網頁 / 書 / 文章 想到什麼通通丟

雖然有個想法: 匯集一份很全很多的資源,
但是太多了也不是很有用.
還是要有推薦幾個先看的.

Open Source Development with CVS, 3rd Edition (本書 GPL!)

線上有完整電子版,
第一章 "Why Open Source Development and CVS Go Together"
就從 "What Is Free Software?" 開始講起
再講到 "What Does CVS Have to Do with It?"

CVS Best Practices
http://www.sanchivi.com/cm/cvs-bestpractices/
比較進階

Free Software Project Management HOWTO
http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Proj-Mgmt-HOWTO/
稍微遠了一些, 在其 bibliography 中提到
Fogel's "guide to using CVS in the free software world" is much more than its subtitle. In the publisher's own words: "Open Source Development with CVS is one of the first books available that teaches you development and implementation of Open Source software." It also includes the best reference and tutorial to CVS I have ever seen. It is the book that was so good that it prompted me to write this HOWTO because I thought the role it tried to serve was so important and useful. Please check it or buy it if you can and are seriously interested in running a free software project.
