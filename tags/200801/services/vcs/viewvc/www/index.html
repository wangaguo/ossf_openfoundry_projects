<h2>What Is ViewVC?</h2>

<p>ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version
   control repositories.  It generates templatized HTML to present
   navigable directory, revision, and change log listings.  It can
   display specific versions of files as well as diffs between those
   versions.  Basically, ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like
   functionality you expect out of your version control tool, but much
   more prettily than the average textual command-line program
   output.</p>

<p>Here are some of the additional features of ViewVC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for filesystem-accessible CVS and Subversion repositories</li>
  <li>Individually configurable virtual host support</li>
  <li>Line-based annotation/blame display</li>
  <li>Revision graph capabilities (<em>CVS only</em>)</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting support</li>
  <li>Commit metadata query facilities</li>
  <li>Template-driven output generation</li>
  <li>Colorized, side-by-side differences</li>
  <li>Tarball generation (by tag/branch for CVS, by revision for 
      Subversion)</li>
  <li>Localization support based on the Accept-Language request header</li>
  <li>Ability to run either as CGI script or as a standalone
      server</li>
  <li>Regexp-based file searching</li>
  <li>INI-like configuration file (as opposed to requiring actual code
      tweaks)</li>
</ul>
