	* wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi: [reported by S.Amrani, Gendarmerie Nat.]
	  Fix: After editing a subscriber email, the list owner might get a
	  "not subscribed to list" error.  The bug happened because the
	  do_set() is used by both list members and list owners. Wwsympa
	  now used the previous_action information to bring the user back
	  to the right page.
